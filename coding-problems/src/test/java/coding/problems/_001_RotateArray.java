     * Question:
     * 
     * Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps. 
     * For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]. 
     * How many different ways do you know to solve this problem?
     * 
     * Solution 1: Intemediate Array
     * Solution 2: Using Bubble Rotate
     * Solution 3: Using Reverse
